I am Miha Cernetic, a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/), in Garching, Germany. I work with [Volker Springel](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/person/55019/2377) on turbulence, high order numerical methods, GPU computing and galaxy formation.

My research in astrophysics is broadly focused on how to employ novel high order numerical techniques to study the role turbulence plays in galaxy formation at the exascale. I am particularly interested in the role of turbulence in the intracluster medium in connection with various buoyancy instabilities and in interstellar medium where it affects the star formation process.

I am an avid self-hoster, feel free to run an internet [speedtest](https://fast.mihac.de/), use my [privatebin instance](https://privatebin.mihac.de/), [effortlesly send large files](https://send.mihac.de/) or locally share files among devices using [pairdrop](https://pairdrop.mihac.de/).
