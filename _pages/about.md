I am Miha Cernetic, since September 2024 I work as a postdoc with [Damiano Caprioli](https://astro.uchicago.edu/~caprioli/) at [University of Chicago](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/) working on hybrid PIC simulations.

I did my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/), in Garching, Germany. With my supervisor [Volker Springel](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/person/55019/2377) I focused on turbulence, high order numerical methods, GPU computing and galaxy formation. 

My research in astrophysics is broadly focused on how to employ novel high order numerical techniques to study the role turbulence plays in galaxy formation at the exascale. I am particularly interested in the role of turbulence in the intracluster medium in connection with various buoyancy instabilities and in interstellar medium where it affects the star formation process.

I come from Slovenia, more precisely from Ajdovščina (Wajdušna), a windy town close to the Adriatic coast. I obtained my BSc in Physics at the University of Ljubljana on CMB anisotropies with [Andreja Gomboc](https://www2.ung.si/~agomboc/ag/About_Me.html). I then moved to Göttingen, Germany to pursue my MSc in Astrophysics at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research where I worked on radiative transfer in 1D stellar atmospheres with [Alexander Shapiro](https://www.mps.mpg.de/SOLVe/staff/38076).

I am an avid self-hoster, feel free to run an internet [speedtest](https://fast.mihac.de/), use my [privatebin instance](https://privatebin.mihac.de/), [effortlesly send large files](https://send.mihac.de/) or locally share files among devices using [pairdrop](https://pairdrop.mihac.de/). For some reason I have been running my own email server since 2013.

When I am not working or fixing servers, I run along the beautiful Isar river in Garching, cycle to one of the many [Bavarian lakes](https://mihac.de/assets/img/lake.jpg)
or climb the highest [European peaks](https://mihac.de/assets/img/mountaintop.jpg).
