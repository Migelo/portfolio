I am Miha Cernetic, a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/), in Garching, Germany. I work with [Volker Springel](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/person/55019/2377) on turbulence, high order numerical methods, GPU computing and galaxy formation.

My research in astrophysics is broadly focused on how to employ novel high order numerical techniques to study the role turbulence plays in galaxy formation at the exascale. I am particularly interested in the role of turbulence in the intracluster medium in connection with various buoyancy instabilities and in interstellar medium where it affects the star formation process.

I was born in Slovenia, where I obtained my BSc in Physics at the University of Ljubljana on CNB anisotropies. I then moved to Germany to pursue my MSc in Astrophysics at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research where I worked on radiative transfer in 1D stellar atmospheres.

I am an avid self-hoster, feel free to run an internet [speedtest](https://fast.mihac.de/), use my [privatebin instance](https://privatebin.mihac.de/), [effortlesly send large files](https://send.mihac.de/) or locally share files among devices using [pairdrop](https://pairdrop.mihac.de/). For some reason I have been running my own own email server since 2013.

When I am not working or fixing servers, I run along the beautiful Isar river in Garching, cycle to one of the many [Bavarian lakes](https://mihac.de/assets/img/lake.jpg)
or climb the highest [European peaks](https://mihac.de/assets/img/mountaintop.jpg).
