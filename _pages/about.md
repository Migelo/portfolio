I am a computational astrophysicist working on turbulence and galaxy formation. I am heavily involved in the development of new high order numerical methods that are specially suitable for modern GPU-accelerated exascale machines.

I am currently a PhD student working with [Volker Springel](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/person/55019/2377) at the [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/), in Garching, Germany.
